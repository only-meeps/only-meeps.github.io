<h1>Welcome to my subdomain!</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Finn!</p>
<p>I code games in Unity (C#) and I have experimented with other engines and languages</p>
<p>such as Godot (C#), Javascript, Java, and well, HTML, because I'm writing this right now!</p>
<p>(although I'm not sure that counts!)</p>
<p>I've done OGPC (Oregon Game Progect Challenge) for a few years now, creating some absolute bangers</p>
<p>(Not really) such as SmokeJumpers! I'm part of (actually lead the team) Meep Games!</p>
<p>This year we are cooking up something special (not really, but I hope so), and I hope to show it to everyone soon!</p>

<h2>Other stuff about me!</h2>\
<h3>Consoles (Opinion)</h3>
<p>My personal opinion on consoles right now? Handhelds are the only ones that make sense!</p>
<p>Forgive me if I yap for to long, but handhelds are the only consoles that make sense because of</p>
<p>one big thing: PC Gaming. As a lot of people know, PC's are the superior console, as you can do pretty much anything on them!</p>
<p>Consoles on the other hand, well, only play games (Although they do that pretty well!). Anyways, where do handhelds come into this?</p>
<p>Laptops are too big to carry on the go, and most games are... uh... not very great on a touchpad. So handhelds bring The Joystick!</p>
<p>Much worse than the mouse, but much better than the touchpad!</p>
<p>And most handhelds can play the same games (if not more) than a gaming laptop!</p>
<p>And they cost a lot less.</p>
<p>Anyways, after all that yapping, you probably want to know: whats your favorite console, Finn?</p>
<p>And I might answer a bit of a weird one: the PS vita!</p>
<p>I'm not gonna explain that, because that would take longer than I want to, and I also want to say my other favorite things!</p>
<h3>Other Favorite things!</h3>
<p>Favorite phone is the Pixel 9A</p>
<p>Favorite handheld is the PS vita</p>
<p>Favorite home console is the PS3</p>
<p>Favorite Game is No Mans Sky (you really should play it if you haven't yet)</p>
<p>Favorite Game Engine is Unity</p>
<p>Favorite programming language is C#</p>
<p>Favorite Smartwatch is the pebble time</p>
<p>Favorite Browser is Chrome (Hey, it's simple!)</p>
<p>And my favorite AI is Gemini</p>
